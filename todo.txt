TODO:
    - Automatic image loader.
        1. Load the image from an enum, I add some value in the enum then I load the specified texture files in some given folder.
            1.1. Images need enum
                - ImagesNeeded enum
            1.2. Build the Filename
                - Using fmt.aprintf() I can build a formatted string, thus building the filename.
            1.3. Search the files in a given folder
                - I loop on the Texture_Type enum to load all the images I need, they just need to have the same name as the file.
                - atlas/load_images()
                - Using os/os2 to load all images files in a directory, it's better than using path/filepath.
        
        2. Return the textures array ?
            - I can do that in both function.

        3. Think about a way to put them into a texture atlas.
            - Not so needed right now, focus on gameplay ?

    - Atlas from multiple png files.
        - Not really needed right now.
    
    - Animation and better sprites.

    - Building.

    - Ennemies.

    - Better World.

    - Animals.

    - Crafting.
